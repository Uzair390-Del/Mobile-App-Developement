#  Android Application Development Lab

##  Topics Covered
- Fragments
- Services
- Broadcast Receivers

##  Introduction

Think of your Android phone like a **magic toy** that can do many things — show games, messages, songs, or even weather updates.

In this lab, we’ll learn about:
- **Fragments**: Little pieces of an app
- **Services**: Invisible helpers
- **Broadcast Receivers**: Message listeners

##  Part 1: Fragments and Their Lifecycle

###  What is a Fragment?

A **Fragment** is like a mini screen inside a big screen.  
Imagine your tablet screen is divided into two parts:
- The top shows your game
- The bottom shows your score  
Each part is a **Fragment**.

###  Fragment Lifecycle (Like a Plant's Life)

| Lifecycle Method | Meaning (Simple)              |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `onAttach()`     | 🌱 The seed is placed in soil |
| `onCreate()`     | 🌿 The seed starts growing     |
| `onCreateView()` | 🍃 Leaves appear (UI shows)    |
| `onActivityCreated()` | 🌼 Becomes part of the garden (Activity) |
| `onStart()`      | 🌞 It grows more              |
| `onResume()`     | 🎉 Ready for action           |
| `onPause()`      | 💤 Takes a break               |
| `onStop()`       | 👋 Not visible anymore        |
| `onDestroyView()`| 🍂 Leaves fall off (UI goes)  |
| `onDetach()`     | 🪴 Removed from the soil      |

###  Lab Task: Create a Fragment-Based App

#### Objective:
- Create an app with **Fragment**:
  - **Fragment** should contain a textview containing some text.
  - Implement each method of Fragment Lifecycle.

##  Part 2: Services in Android

###  What is a Service?

A **Service** is an application component that can perform long running operation in background. It do not provide a User Interface. Another application component can start a service.
A **Service** is like a **robot** that works in the background.  
You don’t see it, but it's doing its job — like playing music or downloading files.
- **Services** are a core component of Android used to perform **long-running operations in the background**.
- Unlike Activities, **Services do not have a User Interface (UI)**.
- They are essential when tasks need to run without user interaction.

---

##  Key Features
- Runs **in the background**.
- **No UI** – doesn't interact with users directly.
- Can be started by other components like **buttons** or **activities**.
- Examples: file download, music playback, photo upload.

---

##  Real-World Examples
1. **File Download**:
   - Click a button → service starts downloading in the background.
   - User continues using the app while download happens.
   - No UI required; might show a notification.

2. **Music Player**:
   - Music keeps playing even when the app is minimized.
   - Service handles playback in the background.

3. **Photo Compression**:
   - App stores and compresses photos silently in the background.
   - No user interaction required.

---

##  Types of Android Services

### 1.  Foreground Service
- Runs in background **but shows a notification** to the user.
- Example: Download manager, music player.
- Must display status or progress to user.
- **Continues running** even if the user leaves the app.

### 2.  Background Service
- Runs silently **without showing notification**.
- Used for tasks like **photo compression** or **data syncing**.
- User is usually unaware it’s running.
- Limited by Android for battery optimization.

### 3.  Bound Service
- **Tightly coupled** with the component (activity/fragment) that started it.
- When the calling component stops, **service stops too**.
- Maintains a **client-server relationship**.
- Example: Music app where UI updates current track info via service.

##  Summary

| Feature                 | Foreground               | Background             | Bound                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| User Notification       | Yes                      | No                     | Optional (Depends on UI)    |
| Continues when app exits| Yes                      | Depends on version     | No                          |
| User Interaction        | Minimal                  | None                   | Frequent                    |
| Examples                | Music Player, Downloads  | Photo Compression      | Media Player Controller     |

##  Part 3: Broadcast Receivers

###  What is a Broadcast Receiver?

A **Broadcast Receiver** is a component in Android used to **receive messages** (called *broadcasts*) from:
- The **Android Operating System**
- Other **applications**

A **Broadcast Receiver** is like a **radio** 📻 — it listens for important updates like:
- Battery low
- Airplane Mode turned ON/OFF

---
##  Why is it called a “Broadcast”?
The message is **sent to all subscribed apps**, not just one — just like a radio broadcast!

---

##  What kind of messages can Android OS broadcast?
1. 🔋 Battery is low  
2. 📶 Device connected to Wi-Fi  
3. ✈️ Airplane mode turned on/off  
4. 🔌 Device starts charging  
5. 📨 A new SMS arrives

---

##  How Broadcast Receivers Work
- Your app can **subscribe** to specific system events.
- When that event happens, Android **sends a broadcast**.
- Your app **receives it instantly** and takes action!

---

##  Example Use Case: Uploading Photos
A photo app wants to upload photos **only when connected to Wi-Fi**:
1. App saves photos in memory.
2. App **waits for Wi-Fi connection broadcast**.
3. Once connected, **uploads photos**.
4. If Wi-Fi disconnects, it **pauses upload**.

 This saves **mobile data** and improves **user experience**!

---

##  Battery Low Example
If the device sends a **battery low** broadcast:
- App **pauses background tasks** to save power.

When the battery is back to normal:
- App **resumes** those tasks.

---

##  Reading Messages Automatically
Some apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Viber) use **broadcasts to read SMS** for **auto-verification**:
- When a message arrives, app reads it **automatically**.
- Makes login/verification **faster and easier**!

---

##  Between Apps
- Broadcasts are usually from the **OS to apps**, but…
- One app can **send a broadcast** to **another app** too.

---

##  Why Use Broadcast Receivers?
- Improve app performance  
- Reduce unnecessary actions (e.g., no uploads on mobile data)  
- React **instantly** to system changes  
- Save battery and data  
- Build **smarter and efficient** apps!

---


###  Lab Task: Airplane Mode Listener

#### Objective:
- Listen for **Airplane Mode** changes
- Show a **Toast**:  
  `"Airplane Mode Turned ON"` or `"OFF"`

---

###  Steps to Implement:

1. Create a class **extending `BroadcastReceiver`**
2. Override the `onReceive()` method
3. Register the receiver in `AndroidManifest.xml`

---

#  What is WebView in Android?

Imagine you're using an app and suddenly, it opens up Google.com or another website inside the app—without jumping to Chrome or Firefox. That's what WebView does!

In simple words:  
 *"WebView is like a mini browser that lives inside your app."*

You can use it to open websites or show online content right inside your Android app.
