# ðŸ“˜ Assignment: Integrating Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models into Android Applications

## ðŸ”° Objective:
To understand how Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models can be embedded into Android applications using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and gain hands-on experience by exploring and implementing a real-world Android ML project from GitHub.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Assignment Instructions:

### 1. Conceptual Understanding:
Write a short report (3-5 pages) answering the following:

#### a. Embedding ML/DL in Android Apps:
- What does it mean to embed a machine learning model in an Android application?
- Why is this important in real-world applications (e.g., image recognition, text classification)?
- Key benefits and challenges of running ML/DL on mobile devices.

#### b. Introduction to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite):
- What is TensorFlow Lite?
- Difference between TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite.
- Why use TFLite for Android ML apps?

#### c. Working with TFLite in Android:
- How to convert a TensorFlow model to TFLite format (`.tflite`).
- How to add the TFLite model in Android Studio.

**Understanding the TFLite Interpreter:**
- What is it?
- How does it load and run inference?

**Step-by-step explanation of using TFLite in Android:**
1. Add TFLite dependency in `build.gradle`
2. Place `.tflite` model in the `assets` folder
3. Load the model using `Interpreter`
4. Prepare input data (preprocessing)
5. Run inference
6. Get and interpret the output

### 2. Hands-on Implementation Task:
You are required to clone and implement the following GitHub project in Android Studio:

ðŸ”— **[https://github.com/Uzair390-Del/NumberGuessingAppTflite.git]**

This project demonstrates the integration of a TFLite model in an Android application.

**Tasks to complete:**
- Successfully run the app on your emulator or Android device.
- Explore and understand each component:
  - How the model is loaded
  - Where and how the `Interpreter` is used
  - How the inputs and outputs are handled
  - How predictions are displayed in the UI
- Comment the code thoroughly to show your understanding.
